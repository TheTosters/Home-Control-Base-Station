# Introduction
  This is code developed on Ci40 dev board from Imagination. It would act as a master controller for my smart house instalation which I would like to deploy in my house. For more technical info please go to wiki of this repo. Documentation might be outdated or missed, creating/maintaining it is a very painful process, but I'll try to do my best.
